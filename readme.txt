I wanted to implement an asset manager, although i didnt manage to finish it. 
I had some trouble with the CreateWICTextureFromFile method apparently not having the right argument types, but i couldnt actually find what was wrong (i probably just missed something honestly). I thought it was maybe that false phantom error it has sometimes but it didnt even let me try to run the project so it doesnt look like it. 
I did also start at least moving more of the asset loading code to the manager but at one point i managed to just get myself really confused about what should go where. I'll keep a whiteboard right next to me next time i look at this and I'll probably have a better time fixing it up then.

The project does currently compile though and I have two sets of transform hierarchies
